= How to use Rack::Csrf with Sinatra

This is a mini Sinatra application with two slightly different rackup files.
Beside Rack you only need Sinatra to try them.

    $ sudo gem install sinatra
    $ thin -R config.ru -p 3000 start
    $ thin -R config-with-raise.ru -p 3000 start

Tested with Sinatra 0.9.4.
