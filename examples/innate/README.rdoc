= How to use Rack::Csrf with Innate

These are two mini, slightly different, Innate applications. You only need
Innate to try them.

    $ sudo gem install manveru-innate --source http://gems.github.com
    $ ruby start.rb
    $ ruby start-with-raise.rb

Tested with Innate 2009.07.

Please, note that Innate is, to some extent, the kernel of Ramaze; "upgrading"
these examples to use Ramaze is left as an exercise to the reader :-)
